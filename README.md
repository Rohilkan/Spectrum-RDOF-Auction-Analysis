# Spectrum_RDOF_Auction_Analysis
Conducting data analysis on FCC Auction 904 (Rural Digital Opportunity 
Fund) for expanding high-speed, low-latency access to rural areas.
I aim to discover outliers in winning bids by various geographical 
divisions and research reasons that explain these discrepancies.

Once cleaned and manipulated, I plan to use the vast national data to 
construct models to predict future bids in similar auctions.

Professor Michelle Connolly.*
